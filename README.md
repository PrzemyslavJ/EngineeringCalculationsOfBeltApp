# EngineeringCalculationsOfBeltApp

This is my first application written in c# by WinForms. It is small tool to engineering calculations for belt transmission
according to engineering polish norms. To write app I use knowledge from my studies of Mechanical Engineering at AGH in Cracow. 
In app I use orginal values from tables in Polish technical norms. I succesfully verifiied correctness of calculations. The main destiny of App is education
writting in C# for me but could be small support tool for engineers nad designers. I can expand of App. If you have a idea please contact with me.
